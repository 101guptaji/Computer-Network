Go – Back – N ARQ provides for sending multiple frames before receiving the acknowledgment for the first frame. The frames are sequentially numbered and a finite number of frames. The maximum number of frames that can be sent depends upon the size of the sending window. If the acknowledgment of a frame is not received within an agreed upon time period, all frames starting from that frame are retransmitted.
