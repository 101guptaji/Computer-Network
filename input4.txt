The Stop and Wait ARQ offers error and flow control, but may cause big performance issues as sender always waits for acknowledgement even if it has next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country though a high speed connection), you canâ€™t use this full speed due to limitations of stop and wait.

Sliding Window protocol handles this efficiency issue by sending more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence numbers. The idea is same as pipelining in architectures.
